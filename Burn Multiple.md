Burn multiple is a capital efficiency metric that takes an all-encompassing view of your business, providing insight into how much revenue you’re generating per dollar burned. It goes beyond net burn rate to show how efficiently your company can generate revenue by deploying capital raised from [[Funding Rounds]].

Unlike other efficiency scores like [[Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)]] / [[Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)]] ratio that focus on just sales and marketing, actions you take across every business function will impact your burn multiple. Understanding your burn multiple helps you find opportunities to extend [[Runway]] through smarter cash management, which is especially important in times of market downturn.
