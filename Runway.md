The burn rate is used by startup companies and investors to track the amount of monthly cash that a company spends before it starts generating its own income. A company’s burn rate is also used as a measuring stick for what is termed its “runway”—the amount of time that the company has before it runs out of money.

If a company has $1 million in the bank and spends $100,000 a month, its runway would be 10 months, derived as:

Total Capital ÷ Monthly Operating Expenses = Runway  

In this case, that would be:

$1,000,000 ÷ $100,000 = 10 months
