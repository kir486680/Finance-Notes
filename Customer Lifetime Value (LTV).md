is a metric that measures the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend on a product or service during the entire duration of their relationship with a business. In other words, it is the estimated amount of revenue a business can expect to receive from a single customer over their lifetime.

LTV can be calculated in various ways depending on the specific business and industry. However, a basic formula for calculating LTV is as follows:

LTV = (Average Order Value x Number of Repeat Transactions x Average Customer Lifespan)

Here are some examples of how to use this formula to calculate LTV:

1.  E-commerce company: An online clothing store has an average order value of $50. On average, customers make four purchases per year and remain customers for two years.

LTV = ($50 x 4 x 2) = $400

So the CLV for this online clothing store is $400 per customer.

2.  Subscription-based company: A streaming service charges $15 per month for its service. On average, customers remain subscribed for two years.

CLV = ($15 x 12 x 2) = $360

So the LTV for this streaming service is $360 per customer.

3.  SaaS company: A software-as-a-service (SaaS) company charges $100 per month for its service. On average, customers use the service for three years.

CLV = ($100 x 12 x 3) = $3,600

So the LTV for this SaaS company is $3,600 per customer.

LTV is an important metric for businesses as it helps them determine the long-term value of their customers and adjust their marketing, sales, and retention strategies accordingly. By increasing LTV, businesses can boost their profitability and build a stronger customer base.
