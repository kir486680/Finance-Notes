Operating Expenditure (OpEx) refers to the expenses that a company incurs in the day-to-day operations of its business. These expenses are incurred to generate revenue and are necessary for the company to continue its normal business operations. OpEx is typically contrasted with Capital Expenditures (CapEx), which are expenses incurred to acquire or upgrade long-term assets such as property, plant, and equipment.

Examples of OpEx include:

-   Employee salaries and benefits
-   Utilities, such as electricity and water
-   Rent or lease payments for office or production space
-   Raw materials and supplies used in production
-   Marketing and advertising expenses
-   Shipping and transportation costs
-   Maintenance and repair costs for equipment and facilities.

It is important to note that OpEx does not include expenses for long-term investments or capital expenditures, which are accounted for separately.
