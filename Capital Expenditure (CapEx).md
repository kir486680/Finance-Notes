Capital expenditure (CapEx) is money that is spent to acquire, repair, update, or improve a fixed company asset, such as a building, business, or equipment. A CapEx is different from an everyday business, which falls under the operating expense category.

The major differences between CapEx and OpEx are that a capital expenditure is a one-time cash outlay, not recurring, and it impacts a long-term asset, or something that can’t be deducted in full in the year in which it was bought.

A new personal printer can be fully written off as an expense when you buy it, but a new roof for your offices cannot be — that’s a major expenditure, or CapEx.

## Capital expenditure examples 

Capital expenditure is one of many types of expenditures businesses need to understand at a high level. CapEx investments need to fall into one of these categories to qualify as such:

-   Acquiring, or buying, a fixed tangible asset, such as a building, or intangible asset, such as a patent or license.
-   Upgrading an existing asset to expand its capacity or capability, such as a computer network or major equipment.
-   Renovating an obsolete or non-functioning asset to make it usable.
-   Repairing an asset to make it usable once again.
-   Adapting an asset for a new use, different from what it had been previously used for.
-   Starting or acquiring a new business.

Again, capital expenditures refer to long-term investments related to your business over a multi-year timeline. Any investment with a useful life expectancy of under a year would not qualify.

## How to calculate capital expenditures

Referencing your businesses income statement and balance sheet, you can calculate capital expenditures using the following formula:

CapEx = [[PPE]] (current period) – [[PPE]] (prior period) + [[Depreciation]] (current period)

PPE refers to “property, plant, and equipment.”

While the formula is relatively straightforward, it's highly recommended to seek the guidance of both a tax and financial professional to ensure you are calculating your capital expenditures properly.
