-   The burn rate is the pace at which a new company not yet generating profits consumes its cash reserves.
-   The burn rate is typically calculated in terms of the amount of cash that the company is spending per month.
-   Gross burn is the total amount of operating costs that a company racks up each month, while net burn is the total amount of money that a company loses monthly.
-   The burn rate affects a company’s financial [[Runway]] which is how long the company has before its operating capital is exhausted; a higher rate means a shorter runway.
- Also consider looking at [[Burn Multiple]] which might be more efficient 

There are two types of burn rates: net burn and gross burn. A company’s gross burn rate is simply the total amount of [[Operating Cost]] that it incurs in expenses each month, expressed as:

Total Monthly Operating Costs = Gross Burn Rate  

A company’s net burn rate, however, is the total amount of money that a company loses each month. This can’t be greater than the gross burn rate, but it can be less.

For example, if a technology startup spends $5,000 monthly on office space, $10,000 on monthly server costs, and $15,000 on salaries and wages for its engineers, its gross burn rate would be $30,000. However, if the company is also producing revenue, its net burn rate would be different, calculated as follows:

(Monthly Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) - Gross Burn Rate = Net Burn Rate  

  
Let’s say that the above company with a gross burn rate of $30,000 also has revenues of $20,000 a month from selling goods, and let’s put the [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)]] to the company at $10,000 a month. The company’s net burn rate would be $20,000, derived as:

($20,000 - $10,000) - $30,000 = -$20,000  

  
Even if the company is spending $30,000 every month, the actual amount it is losing per month is only $20,000. This is an important distinction, because it alters the financial runway. If the company had $100,000 in the bank, its runway would be five months rather than three months. The longer stretch of time will affect both how the managers outline the company’s strategy and the amount of money that an investor might be willing to put into the company.

If the burn rate begins to exceed its forecast, or if revenue fails to meet expectations, the usual recourse is to reduce the burn rate, regardless of how much money is in the bank. This requires rethinking the startup’s cost structure and usually means reducing staff and/or other major cost drivers, such as office lease, technology, and marketing.
