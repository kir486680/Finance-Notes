Fractional reserve banking is a system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are required to be available for withdrawal. Banks only need to keep a specific amount of cash on hand and can create loans from the money you deposit. Fractional reserves work to expand the economy by freeing capital for lending. Today, most economies' financial systems use fractional reserve banking.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

-   Fractional reserve banking describes a system whereby banks can loan out a certain amount of the deposits that they have on their balance sheets.
-   Banks used to be required to keep a certain amount of the cash depositors placed in their accounts in reserve.
-   All depository institutions are paid a specific interest rate on their reserve balance to encourage holding reserves.

<h6> Understanding Fractional Reserve Banking: </h6>

When you create an account at a bank, in the contract, you agree to allow that bank to use a percentage of your deposits as loans to other bank customers. This doesn't mean you don't have access to the money you deposited; it only means that if you want to remove more than the percentage a bank keeps on hand, such as the entire balance, from the account, the bank will need to access funds from somewhere else to give you your balance.

When you deposit money in your savings account, your bank can use an amount specified as capital to fund loans and pay you for using your money. For instance, say you deposited $2,000 in a savings account. Savings accounts pay interest—generally between 0.5% and 2%—so you receive an interest payment on your money, and the bank can use part of it in a loan. In turn, the bank might want to access 80% of your money to use as loans to other customers.

You receive interest as an incentive for keeping money in an account the bank can use to create loans.

The Federal Reserve sets interest rates. They are based on economic circumstances and how it decides it can best meet its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. If a bank needs capital to fund loans, withdrawals, pay debts, or meet other obligations, it can borrow from other banks and pay them interest. As a last resort, the [[Fed]] maintains a service called the [[Discount Window]], where it lends money to banks at a higher interest rate than they charge between themselves. This encourages banks to seek funds from each other rather than the [[Fed]].

Interest is charged between financial institutions based on a range set by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors called the federal reserve target rate range. The average interest rate banks charge each other is referred to as the effective [[Federal Funds Rate]].

Example: 

The fractional reserve banking process creates money that is inserted into the economy. When you deposit that $2,000, your bank might lend 10% of it to other customers, along with 10% from five other customers' accounts. This creates a loan of $1,000 for the customer needing a loan.

Your balance still reflects $2,000, and the customers that the bank borrowed from also see their balances remain unchanged. If all six customers have account balances of $2,000, it will look something like this:

You and five other customers have $2,000 in savings.
If the bank can use 90% of its deposits for loans, the available capital is $9,000 (90% of $10,000).
The bank borrows 10% from each of the six accounts, totaling $1,000.
There is still a balance of $2,000 in each account ($10,000 total between the six accounts).
The bank essentially created $1,000 and lent it to the borrower.
You receive interest payments on your $2,000, and the bank receives interest at a higher rate from the borrower to pay your interest and profit from the service.
