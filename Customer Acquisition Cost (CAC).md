### Importance of Customer Acquisition Cost

CAC is a key business metric that many businesses and investors look at. In fact, many companies end up failing due to not fully understanding their customer acquisition cost.

#### 1. Improving return on investment

Understanding the cost to acquire new customers is crucial to analyzing marketing return on investment. For example, consider a company that uses several channels to acquire customers:

![Sample Channel Figures](https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/customer-acquisition-cost2-1024x188.png)

By using CAC, a company is able to determine the most cost-effective way to acquire customers. In the table above, we can see that Social Media provides the lowest acquisition cost while Social Events cost the most. A company presented with this data may consider using social media marketing more to generate more customers.

#### 2. Improving profitability and profit margin

Understanding its CAC provides a business with the ability to fully analyze the value per customer and improve its profit margins. For example, assume that the value of each customer to a business is $60.

Relating it to the example above, which channel would you choose to use? A business that does not understand CAC would adversely affect profitability by choosing to use Social Events as a channel. The channels Social Media and Posters would improve profitability for the company as the CAC is lower than the value per customer.
