What Does GMV Mean?
GMV means gross merchandise value or gross merchandise volume, usually referring to the total value of merchandise sold over a given period of time through a [[Customer to Customer (C2C)]] exchange site.


Is Gross Merchandise Value the Same as Revenue?
Depending on the type of e-commerce site, GMV is the same as gross revenue. However, for sites like eBay, it is a reflection of the total value of goods sold, but not the actual revenue the company makes, as a portion of those revenues is for the sellers of the goods. The actual revenue that eBay makes would be from the fees it charges on the sales.

What Is Gross Merchandise Value in a Startup?
In a startup, GMV is the gross merchandise revenue: the total revenue that a company generates through the sale of its goods or services. It is important that GMV is measured in conjunction with net sales, which takes into account deductions.

How Is Gross Merchandise Value Calculated?
GMV is calculated by multiplying the total amount of goods sold by their sales price in a given period. GMV = Sales Price of Goods x Number of Goods Sold.

Example of GMV
Two of the most well-known C2C sites are eBay and Etsy. Say, during the first quarter of the fiscal year, eBay sold 100 goods. For simplicity's sake, all of those goods were priced at $5. For the first quarter, eBay's GMV would be 100 X $5 = $500.

Now, for example, say that in the same quarter, Etsy sold 80 goods, and again, for simplicity's sake, all of the goods were priced at $4. For the first quarter, Etsy's GMV would be 80 x $4 = $320.

In this example, eBay (EBAY) has a better GMV at $500 than Etsy (ETSY) does at $320. However, this does not tell the whole story. On these sites, a portion of the revenue has to go back to the seller that sold the goods; eBay and Etsy only keep the fees they charge, which is their actual revenue.

In this example, eBay charges a fee of 2%, and so it would bring in $10 ($500 x 2%). Etsy, on the other hand, charges a higher fee: 4% in this example. Etsy would bring in $12.80 ($320 x 4%). In this example, Etsy actually performed better because it brought in higher take-home revenues.
